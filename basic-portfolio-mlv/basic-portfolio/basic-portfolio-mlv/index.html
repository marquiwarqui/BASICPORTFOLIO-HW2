                        <div>안녕하세요! 마르코임니다! Hi! my name is Marco de Vera, and this is going to be my first web portfolio.
                                < I 'd like to tell you a bit about myself. I love music, movies, and videogames,
        but what a lot of people dont really know about me is that I love adventures and the outdoors.
        My favorite time of day is early in the morning as noone is awake yet.</div></p>


        <p>
        <div>I'm just putting random stuff here so I can fill up the body of my page. I hope you enjoy reading content
                                        about nothing. Did you have a good day today? I hope so because its about to get really boring
                                        To be honest I 'm having a harder time filling this out than a dating profile account
        Seriously, I'm having a pannic attack trying to fill this out. Kpop is the only thing keeping me from crying. Depression
                                        Sucks!</div>
